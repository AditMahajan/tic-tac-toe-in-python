tic tac toe game by using python

Problem Statement: Tic-Tac-Toe is among the games played between two
players played on a 3 x 3 square grid. Each player inhabits a cell in their
respective turns, keeping the objective of placing three similar marks in a
vertical, horizontal, or diagonal pattern. The first player utilizes the Cross (X)
as the marker, whereas the other utilizes the Naught or Zero (O).


Solution: We are going to build a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we can
play in the command-line. Initially, we’ll make an empty game board and then
we’ll take inputs from the players and we’ll check for the winning condition
and if the whole board gets filled and no one wins, we’ll declare the result as
“Tie” and ask users if they want to restart the game. The board is numbered
like the keyboard’s number pad. And thus, a player can make their move in the
game board by entering the number from the keyboard number pad.
